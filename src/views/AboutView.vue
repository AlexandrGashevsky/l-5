        <h1>The Beginning of Samurai</h1>
        <time>2003-2008</time>
        <p>Samurai was formed in 2003 by <strong>Johnny Silverhand</strong>, a famous rockerboy and revolutionary. Together with Kerry Eurodyne, Denny and Nancy, the band started to perform in local bars and clubs in Night City. Their unique sound and rebellious lyrics quickly gained popularity among the people of the city.</p>

<p>During this period, Samurai released their first album "The Ballad of Buck Ravers" which included hit songs such as <strong>"Chippin' In"</strong>, <strong>"Never Fade Away"</strong>, and <strong>"Blistering Love"</strong>. The album was a huge success and helped to establish Samurai as a symbol of hope for those fighting against the oppression of megacorporations.</p>

	<h1>The Rise of Samurai</h1>
	<time>2009-2015</time>
  <p>After the success of their first album, Samurai went on to tour extensively throughout the United States and Europe. They also collaborated with other famous artists such as Lizzy Wizzy and Kerry Eurodyne.</p>

<p>During this period, Samurai released their second album "Crimson Skies" which included hit songs such as <strong>"The Star of the Stage"</strong>, <strong>"Sands of Time"</strong>, and <strong>"Rebel's Roar"</strong>.

	<h1>The Fall of Samurai</h1>
	<time>2016-2020</time>
  <p>Unfortunately, the success of Samurai did not last forever. In 2016, the band experienced a major setback when Kerry Eurodyne left the group to pursue a solo career. This led to a decline in the popularity of the band and a decrease in the number of shows they were able to perform.</p>

<p>Despite these challenges, Samurai continued to release music during this period. Their third album "Soulkiller" included hit songs such as <strong>"Ghost of Night City"</strong>, <strong>"Riders on the Storm"</strong>, and <strong>"Samurai Spirit"</strong>. However, the album did not sell as well as their previous ones.</p>

	<h1>The Return of Samurai</h1>
	<time>2021-present</time>
  <p>After a long hiatus, Samurai made a comeback in 2021 with their fourth album "Rise Up". The album included hit songs such as <strong>"Warriors of Night City"</strong>, <strong>"No More Lies"</strong>, and <strong>"Rebel Hearts"</strong>. The band's renewed popularity was also helped by the fact that <strong>Johnny Silverhand</strong> was featured in the hit video game Cyberpunk 2077.</p>

<p>Today, Samurai continues to perform and inspire people all over Night City. They remain a symbol of hope and rebellion against the megacorporations that control the city.</p>
